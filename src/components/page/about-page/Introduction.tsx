        Computers have been my passion since childhood, starting with my
        uncle&apos;s old LCD display where I learned the basics of computing.
        Through his assistance and my self-driven exploration, I quickly
        mastered essential computer skills and developed a strong foundation in
        digital technology.

        My programming journey began in high school, starting with HTML and CSS
        before advancing to JavaScript. University opened new doors as I
        embraced modern frameworks like Flutter and libraries like React,
        expanding my development capabilities significantly.

        Now, I architect and build sophisticated full-stack applications using
        modern technology stacks. My projects combine clean design with powerful
        functionality, reflecting my commitment to excellence in software
        development and continuous learning.
