        From a very young age, I have always been fascinated by computing, even
        before I can remember. My uncle, a tech and networking enthusiast, owned
        an old LCD display. Whenever he came home, he would teach me how to type
        and navigate a personal computer. In his absence, I practiced what I had
        learned. I learned how to browse the internet, play games using the
        keyboard and mouse, download files via BitTorrent, and write documents,
        among other skills.

        As time went by, I was introduced to the concept of programming.
        Initially, I struggled to grasp it, but I gave it another try during my
        first year in high school. I started with front-end web technologies
        like HTML and CSS. As the years passed, I progressed to JavaScript.
        During my first year at university, I was introduced to frameworks like
        Flutter and libraries like React.

        Today, I utilize over five top libraries and the latest tech stack to
        build elegant and efficient full stack web applications. I build cutting edge projects as a hobby. My journey from basic
        computer skills to advanced programming has been driven by a deep
        passion for technology and continuous learning.
